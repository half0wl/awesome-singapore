# How to contribute

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. You can help make this awesome list larger and allow more people more access to more resources.

## Getting started

### Check out the the Issues

Some people will start issues to give ideas on what to add. **Make sure you ask the issue creator if you can make a pull request**. Do **NOT** do it without their permission.

### Writing some code!

Contributing to a project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is you're first time, these are the steps you should take.

-   Fork this repo.

And that's it! Read the code available and change the part you don't like! You're change should not remove any items (Unless you have a good reason for removing them) and other than that, go att it.

When you're done, submit a pull request and for one of the maintainers to check it out. We would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.

One more thing, the items in this list should somehow be related to Singapore. Please do not add random items.

### Code Style

Please ensure you are following the code style when submitting a pull request. This creates less work for the maintainers, who have to check code style and ask you to adjeust it or edit it themselves.

### Rules

Here is a consolidated list of rules.

1.  Make sure your item is related to Singapore
2.  Please read the code of conduct before commenting, create a pull request or creating an issue.
3.  Do not delete a item from the list unless there is a good reason (Make sure you state this reason in your PR).
